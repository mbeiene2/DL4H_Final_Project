# DL4H_Final_Project - Reproducing research paper - Towards automated clinical coding
This project is on draft and development stage
This repository is for reproducing the research paper – Towards automated clinical coding. This project is part of class project for Deep Learning for Healthcare at UIUC. Currently, the repo consists of
-	Step 1_Data_processing_and_embedding.py – This is for cleaning the raw dataset, creating levels for ICD_9_CM and embedding it
-	Step2_GRU(X)_GRU(Z)_model_training.py – This is the code for GRU(X)-GRU(Z) model. This code is still in development. Level1 and level2 of ICD_9_CM are completed. There are level3 and level 4 to be completed
-	Step 3_tfidf(d)_atomic_model_training.py – This is the code for tfidf(d). This code is still in development. Level1 and level2 of ICD_9_CM are completed. There are level3 and level 4 to be completed.
